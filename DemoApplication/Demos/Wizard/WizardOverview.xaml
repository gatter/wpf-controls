                The wizard framework is a set of controls that allows a developer to
                create Windows Presentation Framework (WPF) wizards that
                conform to the Wizard97 and Aero guidelines. The features of the 
                wizard framework have been designed, from the outset, to be highly
                configurable but importantly without compromising ease of use. Wizards
                can be quickly created irresepctive of whether they are a
                linear sequence of pages or a more complex decision based pages.

                By building on key WPF concepts such as Templates and Styles this wizard framework
                can be used to create highly customisable wizards. Along with some additional properties it 
                is these concepts that are used to provide the Aero and Wizard97 styled wizards. The same
                concepts can be used to extend the default styles to ensure that all the wizards in an 
                application have a consistant appearance.

                The wizard framwork provides a feature rich set of design-time adornmets that simplifies 
                the navigation between pages whilst the wizards are being created. 
                These adornments have been disigned to be unintrusive and
                to augment the deisgn-time support already present in Visual Studio.

                All wizards support the use of transitions to animate the movement between pages. These transitions
                lift the wizard in a way that is unique to WPF applications. Each page can
                control whether the user is allowed to navigate to the next page by simply binding properties of the page 
                to the underlying model. Move complex navigation can be achieved by simply assigning wizard commands to
                <Bold>CommandLink</Bold> buttons.
