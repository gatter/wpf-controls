                WPF is a very powerful framework for building rich and visually appealing applications;
                however, the framework can be considered lacking when it comes to features that are
                present in Win32. A straightforward work around to this issues is to build a bridging
                API between WPF/C# and the Win32 dlls, most of which is provided by the Microsoft's
                Windows API Code Pack. A better a more complicated solution is to provide a clean room
                implementation of this functionality in pure WPF (or as close as possible). One
                significant advantage is that some functionality that is only accessible to Vista
                or Windows 7 can be via the Code Pack can be made available to XP. This means that you
                can provide an application that looks like a modern Windows 7 application whilst keeping
                the ability to tun the application on XP.
