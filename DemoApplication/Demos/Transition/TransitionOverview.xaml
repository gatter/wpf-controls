                The transition framework is a set of controls and effects that quickly enables any developer
                to provide stylistic transitions without writing any code. In contrast to any other transition
                system this framework allows multiple transition to occur at the same time. This is important
                because the last thing you want in a WPF application is the stutering effect of an animation
                jumping to an early conclusion. This handling of multiple transitions is so complete that
                if the required content is currently in a transition then all the inflight transitions
                are seamlessly reversed to ensure the correct content is displayed as smoothly as possible.

                There are numerouse transition effects that can be chosen from. Each one supports
                the ability to run overlapped or sequential as well as being reversed if required.
                All but the most compicated transitions can be created by simplying using XAML to
                define styles and storyboards.

                Transitions can be managed at three different levels:
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                <Bold>TransitionItemsControl</Bold> provides a simple way to
                transition between items that have a well defined sequence. When transitioning 
                between two items you have the option to transition the items in sequence, similarly
                to shuffling a deck of cards. If the item to be transitioned is before the current
                item then the reverse animation is used.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                <Bold>TransitionControl</Bold> will simply perform a transition when its content is
                changed. If the new content is being hidden by an inflight animation the appropriate
                animations will be reversed to show the correct content.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
                <Bold>TransitionPresenter</Bold> is the primative that performs the actual transition.
                With this FrameworkElement the transition can only be initiated programatically. However,
                this allows the transitions to be put almost any environment.
