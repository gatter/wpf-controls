                The <Bold>Icon</Bold> element provides the ability to render the best frames of an icon depending on its size.
                It can also snap the image to device pixels as well as having the ability to transform its colours.
                Even though this element is optimised for rendering icons it can also be used to render simple bitmaps.

                If <Bold>ActiveIcon</Bold> is used as a child of an element that derives from the
                <Bold>ButtonBase</Bold> element then the icon will be desatured when the button is disabled and will be highlighted
                when the mouse hovers over the button.

                to the user. Shield icons are used in Windows to provide information on security related tasks; whilst 
                task icons are used to signify that a message is associated with a question, warning, error etc.
                All icons have multiple frames which when used with the
                <Bold>Icon</Bold> element provide very clear images when sized from 16x16 to 96x96.
