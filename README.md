WPF controls
============

Introduction
------------
I created this controls library quite some time ago, probably around 2008 and was originally published on CodePlex.
I spent quite a bit of time working with design time support for the wizard controls in Visual Studio 2008 & 2010.
Unfortunatly, work and everyday life has meant that I have not kept this library as up to date as I would have liked.
 
My intent over the next few months is to bring the library up to date with support for Visual Studio 2012/13.

So, if you are using Visual Studio 2012/13 then please excuse the bugs with the wizard design time support. 
I will get around to fixing them soon.

Compiling
---------
To compile this library you need to install the [Shader Task Library](http://wpf.codeplex.com/downloads/get/40167)
